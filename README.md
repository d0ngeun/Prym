# PRYM | 
A small and lean in-development ai/ml library

## Benchmarks:  
- ML: moon points, mnist,   
- DL: cart and pole, atari, self driving replication,  
- GAN: image generation, video generation  
- NLP: chat bot, sentiment analysis  
- RL: TBD
- TBD  

## Roadmap:  
- get parity with micrograd  
- study cpu and convex optimizations to implement more optimization options  
- add developed matrix, calculus, probability, optimization library  
- study esl and implement core ideas  
- add support for popular libraries such as numpy, openCV, YOLO, etc.  
- add support for gpu programming  
- add support for deep learning  
- add support for robotics and systems cross  
- add C++ ports for microchip programming  
- add to pip ecosystem  
- study pytorch and implement core ideas  
- implement experimental research. DreamerV3, etc.
